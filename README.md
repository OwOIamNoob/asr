A clean template to kickstart your deep learning project üöÄ‚ö°üî•<br>
Click on [<kbd>Use this template</kbd>](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template/generate) to initialize new repository.

_Suggestions are always welcome!_

</div>

<br>

## üìå¬†¬†Introduction <br>
This is an adaptation of Laos_Viet Machine Translation Project to Pytorch Lightning Hydra, progress is still being made.

To run training, simply run train.py file in src folder, all configuration is customized in configs folder.

To run evaluation, simply run eval.py, if you want to run inference only, comment trainer.eval and run trainer.predict instead in the same file !!

The main process is just calling other process, the sub_process is defined in the configs and instantiated by hydra utilization. 

The process is still faulty, on progress of resolving to seamless training

A pre-configured vocab is a must, import our vocab or enumerate your own vocab for convenience, each vocab's header should consist 3 components: no. of words, embedding dimension and number of special keywords. 

Embedding can also be read with vocab and is stored  inside Vocab class.You can just simply run download.sh to import the vocab :D 

**Why you might want to use it:**

‚úÖ Save on boilerplate <br>
Easily add new models, datasets, tasks, experiments, and train on different accelerators, like multi-GPU, TPU or SLURM clusters.

‚úÖ Education <br>
Thoroughly commented. You can use this repo as a learning resource.

‚úÖ Reusability <br>
Collection of useful MLOps tools, configs, and code snippets. You can use this repo as a reference for various utilities.

**Why you might not want to use it:**

‚ùå Things break from time to time <br>
 
 I hate this

Lightning and Hydra are still evolving and integrate many libraries, which means sometimes things break. For the list of currently known problems visit [this page](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template/labels/bug).

‚ùå Not adjusted for data engineering <br>

Everytime, new datamodule, sad thing.

Template is not really adjusted for building data pipelines that depend on each other. It's more efficient to use it for model prototyping on ready-to-use data.

‚ùå Overfitted to simple use case <br>

Very over-fitted, only a transformer can cause so much pain

The configuration setup is built with simple lightning training in mind. You might need to put some effort to adjust it for different use cases, e.g. lightning fabric.

‚ùå Might not support your workflow <br>

Sad

For example, you can't resume hydra-based multirun or hyperparameter search.

> **Note**: _Keep in mind this is unofficial community project._

<br>

## Main Technologies

[PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) - a lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research. Think of it as a framework for organizing your PyTorch code.

[Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) - a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications. The key feature is the ability to dynamically create a hierarchical configuration by composition and override it through config files and the command line.

<br>

## Main Ideas

- [**Rapid Experimentation**](#your-superpowers): thanks to hydra command line superpowers
- [**Minimal Boilerplate**](#how-it-works): thanks to automating pipelines with config instantiation
- [**Main Configs**](#main-config): allow you to specify default training configuration
- [**Experiment Configs**](#experiment-config): allow you to override chosen hyperparameters and version control experiments
- [**Workflow**](#workflow): comes down to 4 simple steps
- [**Experiment Tracking**](#experiment-tracking): Tensorboard, W&B, Neptune, Comet, MLFlow and CSVLogger
- [**Logs**](#logs): all logs (checkpoints, configs, etc.) are stored in a dynamically generated folder structure
- [**Hyperparameter Search**](#hyperparameter-search): simple search is effortless with Hydra plugins like Optuna Sweeper
- [**Tests**](#tests): generic, easy-to-adapt smoke tests for speeding up the development
- [**Continuous Integration**](#continuous-integration): automatically test and lint your repo with Github Actions
- [**Best Practices**](#best-practices): a couple of recommended tools, practices and standards

## üöÄ¬†¬†Quickstart
You have to do this before doing anything
```bash
# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Template contains example with MNIST classification.<br>
When running `python src/train.py` you should see something like this:

## ‚ö°¬†¬†Your Superpowers

<details>
<summary><b>Override any config parameter from command line

This is conventional when you want to test the experiment without making changes in the working tree. Hehe </b></summary>

```bash
python train.py trainer.max_epochs=20 model.optimizer.lr=1e-4
```

> **Note**: You can also add new parameters with `+` sign.

```bash
python train.py +model.new_param="owo"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Train on CPU, GPU, multi-GPU and TPU</b></summary>

```bash
```

> **Warning**: Currently there are problems with DDP mode, read [this issue](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template/issues/393) to learn more.
And the model mismatching between logits and target by one, sorry.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Train with mixed precision</b></summary>

```bash
# train with pytorch native automatic mixed precision (AMP)
python train.py trainer=gpu +trainer.precision=16
```

</details>

<!-- deepspeed support still in beta
<details>
<summary><b>Optimize large scale models on multiple GPUs with Deepspeed</b></summary>

```bash
python train.py +trainer.
```

</details>
 -->

<details>
<summary><b>Train model with any logger available in PyTorch Lightning, like W&B or Tensorboard</b></summary>

```yaml
# set project and entity names in `configs/logger/wandb`
wandb:
  project: "your_project_name"
  entity: "your_wandb_team_name"
```

```bash
# train model with Weights&Biases (link to wandb dashboard should appear in the terminal)
python train.py logger=wandb
```

> **Note**: Lightning provides convenient integrations with most popular logging frameworks. Learn more [here](#experiment-tracking).

> **Note**: Using wandb requires you to [setup account](https://www.wandb.com/) first. After that just complete the config as below.

> **Note**: Click [here](https://wandb.ai/hobglob/template-dashboard/) to see example wandb dashboard generated with this template.
